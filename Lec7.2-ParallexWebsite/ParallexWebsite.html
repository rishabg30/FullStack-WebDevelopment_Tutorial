        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are
          often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
          achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only
          be obtained by such activities
          <br />
          <br />
          Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the
          purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing
          and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains
          in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers â€“ the
          British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw
          global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental
          constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure
          education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

          <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are
          several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing,
          cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle
          speedway. Cycling is also known as bicycling or biking, is the
          activity of riding a bicycle or other type of cycle. It encompasses
          the use of human-powered vehicles such as balance bikes, unicycles,
          tricycles, and quadricycles. Cycling is practised around the world for
          purposes including transport, recreation, exercise, and competitive
          sport.

          <br />
          <br />
          Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You'll burn about 400 calories
          an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs,
          hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that's gentle on your back,
          hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You can cycle on the
          road, a bike path, or a mountain trail.

          <h2 class="description">PARA-GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
          or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is
          maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents
          in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air
          flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br />
          <br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
